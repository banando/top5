# Top 5

This is my Ruby on Rails app designed to create lists of top 5's. the
initial focus of this app is for top 5 lists of foods in a given field
or topic. For example the top 5 pizza dishes I've had. These lists can
be shared and searched through. 

The technologies I used to make this is Ruby on Rails. I used postgresql 
for the databases. The hosting site I used was Heroku. User stories, 
ERD's, and other work flow helpers were set up on trello.
